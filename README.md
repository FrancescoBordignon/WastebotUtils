I mainly work using my company Gitlab, this repo contains some of the code used for the iWAMO project and that possibly will be used in future projects (camera image reprojection, grasping approaches etc). This repo is also intended to be used to check my coding style. The iWAMO project was an EU founded project where we focused on developing an autonomous system for waste sorting. As it can be seen in the video below_short_wastebot.mp4
